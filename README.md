# ProjectAthena - Educational Management System

ProjectAthena is a comprehensive educational management system built with modern .NET technologies and React. It provides a robust platform for managing courses, students, teachers, and enrollments in educational institutions.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

ProjectAthena follows a modern microservices architecture using .NET Aspire for orchestration:

### System Components

- **üåê ProjectAthena.MinimalApi**: Main API service using ASP.NET Core Minimal APIs
- **üíæ ProjectAthena.Data**: Entity Framework Core data layer with PostgreSQL
- **üìã ProjectAthena.Dtos**: Data Transfer Objects for API contracts
- **üîÑ ProjectAthena.DbWorkerService**: Database seeding and migration service
- **‚öõÔ∏è AspireJavaScript.Vite**: React frontend with TypeScript and Vite
- **‚öôÔ∏è ProjectAthena.ServiceDefaults**: Common service configurations
- **üß™ ProjectAthena.Tests**: Comprehensive integration tests

### Technology Stack

| Component | Technology |

| **Testing** | xUnit with comprehensive integration tests |
| **Production Features** | Environment-specific configs, CancellationToken support |

## üèõÔ∏è Design Decisions

### **Modern API Architecture**
- **Minimal APIs**: Lightweight, high-performance endpoints with automatic OpenAPI generation
- **Type Safety**: End-to-end type safety with auto-generated TypeScript types from C# DTOs
- **Service Discovery**: .NET Aspire automatic service resolution and configuration
- **Hot Reloading**: Vite HMR for instant frontend updates during development

### **Clean Architecture**
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between API, business logic, and data layers
- **Dependency Injection**: Built-in .NET DI container for loose coupling
- **Service Layer Pattern**: Business logic encapsulated in service classes
- **Repository Pattern**: Implicit through Entity Framework Core DbContext

### **Error Handling Strategy**
- **Endpoint Level**: Comprehensive error handling with specific exception types
- **Service Level**: Clean business logic without unnecessary try-catch blocks
- **Consistent Responses**: Standardized error responses with trace IDs for debugging
- **Logging**: Structured logging throughout the application

### **Security Implementation** üîí
- **Authentication**: JWT Bearer tokens with ASP.NET Core Identity
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (Admin, Teacher, Student)
- **Password Policy**: Enforced complexity requirements
- **Account Lockout**: Protection against brute force attacks
- **Environment-Specific JWT**: Secure secret management for development vs production
- **CORS Security**: Configurable CORS policies with production restrictions
- **Secret Management**: Integration with User Secrets, Environment Variables, and Azure Key Vault

### **Database Design**
- **Soft Deletes**: Entities marked as inactive rather than physically deleted
- **Audit Trail**: CreatedAt/UpdatedAt timestamps on all entities
- **Referential Integrity**: Proper foreign key relationships
- **Unique Constraints**: Course codes, student numbers, employee numbers

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 9.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0)
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) - **Must be running with healthy engine**
- [Node.js 20+](https://nodejs.org)
- **Optional**: [Visual Studio 2022 17.12+](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/)

**Important**: Ensure Docker Desktop is running and the Docker engine is healthy before starting the application, as PostgreSQL runs in a Docker container.

### Production Deployment Notes

**Security Configuration**:
- Set `Jwt:SecretKey` in production using:
  - Azure Key Vault (recommended)
  - Environment variables
  - User secrets (development only)
- Configure CORS origins for your production domains
- Use HTTPS in production environments

**Build Verification**:
```bash
# Ensure 0 warnings and errors
dotnet build --configuration Release

# Verify TypeScript compilation
cd AspireJavaScript.Vite
npx tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.app.json

# Run all tests
dotnet test
```

### Local Development Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KostaKing/ProjectAthena
   cd ProjectAthena
   ```

2. **Install .NET Aspire Workload** (if encountering Aspire SDK issues)
   ```bash
   dotnet workload install aspire
   ```
   
   **Note**: If you encounter errors like "Unable to load Aspire SDK" or "Aspire workload not found", run the above command to install the required Aspire workload.

3. **Run the Application**

   **Option A: Visual Studio**
   - Open `ProjectAthena.sln`
   - Set `ProjectAthena.AppHost` as startup project
   - Press F5 to run

   **Option B: .NET CLI**
   ```bash
   cd AspireJavaScript.AppHost
   dotnet run
   ```

   **‚è≥ First Run Note**: The initial startup may take several minutes as Docker images (PostgreSQL, pgAdmin) are downloaded. You can monitor the download progress in the .NET Aspire dashboard logs.

4. **Access the Application**
   - **.NET Aspire Dashboard**: Auto-launches in browser
   - **React Frontend**: Available through Aspire dashboard
   - **API Documentation**: Swagger UI available in development
   - **Database Admin**: pgAdmin available through Aspire dashboard

   **SSL Certificate Issues**: If you encounter SSL certificate errors when accessing the application, try:
   - Using a different browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
   - Opening the application in incognito/private mode
   - Accepting the self-signed certificate warning in your browser

5. **Login to the Application**
   - Navigate to the React frontend through the Aspire dashboard
   - On the login page, **click the "Admin" button** to auto-fill login credentials
   - This will populate the email and password fields with the default admin account
   - Click "Sign In" to access the admin dashboard
   
   **Quick Login Options**:
   - **Admin**: Click "Admin" button for auto-fill (recommended for testing)
   - **Teacher**: Click "Teacher" button for instructor account
